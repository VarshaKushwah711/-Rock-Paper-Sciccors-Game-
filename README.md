# 🎮 Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

## 🌟 Overview

Welcome to the *Rock-Paper-Scissors* game, a classic showdown that’s fun for all ages! This web-based application invites you to challenge a computer opponent in a battle of wits. Choose between three iconic options: 🪨 Rock, 📄 Paper, or ✂ Scissors. With every click, the computer randomly selects its choice, and together we’ll discover who comes out on top! 🏆

## 🔄 How It Works

1. *User Selection*: With a simple click, you pick one of the three buttons (🪨 Rock, 📄 Paper, or ✂ Scissors) to make your choice.
2. *Computer Choice*: The game then randomly generates a choice for the computer—will it be Rock, Paper, or Scissors? 🤖
3. *Determine Winner*: The winner is revealed using these classic rules:
